I will refactor the project to improve maintainability and update the branding as requested.

### 1. Update Branding
- Change "Powered by Gemini 2.5 Flash Image" to "**Powered by MKG**" in the application header.

### 2. Restructure Project (Standard `src` Architecture)
To improve code organization and maintainability, I will move source files into a `src` directory:
- **Create `src/` directory**: Move `App.tsx`, `index.tsx`, `index.css`, `types.ts`, `components/`, and `services/` into it.
- **Update Configuration**:
  - Update `index.html` to point to the new location of `index.tsx`.
  - Configure `vite.config.ts` and `tsconfig.json` to support the `src` directory and `@/` path alias.

### 3. Component Refactoring (Decompose `App.tsx`)
The `App.tsx` file is currently too large (600+ lines). I will break it down into smaller, focused components and hooks:

- **Extract Components**:
  - `src/components/Header.tsx`: Contains the navigation and branding (including the text change).
  - `src/components/Sidebar.tsx`: Manages the image list and uploading.
  - `src/components/DesignStudio.tsx`: Handles design configuration (style selection, prompt input).
  - `src/components/PreviewArea.tsx`: Displays the image comparison (Before/After).
  - `src/components/PropertyCreation.tsx`: Handles new property project creation.

- **Extract Logic into Custom Hooks**:
  - `src/hooks/useAuth.ts`: Encapsulate authentication logic.
  - `src/hooks/useProject.ts`: Manage state for properties, images, and generation mode.

This refactoring will make the codebase cleaner, easier to read, and easier to maintain in the future.
